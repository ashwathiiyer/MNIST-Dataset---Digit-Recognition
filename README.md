# MNIST-Dataset---Digit-Recognition
Exploratory study of various data selection techniques and ML algorithms 
In this project, I will look at different data selection and ML algorithms, using the MNIST handwritten digits dataset as an example. I am primarily doing this for educational purposes, so the project is extensively documented.
